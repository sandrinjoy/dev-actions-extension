## Dev Actions Chrome Extension

This is a chrome extension which i use it for making chrome better for me.

I used to have many extensions for small-small use cases. So I thought of just creating one single extension for all of those.

### Features Added

- Tab Sorter (normal sorting based on url. Also can be done using page title )
- X Failed Chrome Restart X (On my mac, I am facing this weird chrome issue while i try to do any input - upload action sometimes the finder gets frozen. So for fix, i have to restart chrome. I usually do chrome://restart and it fixes. But when i tried using the extension chrome doesn't allow it due to security reasons.)
